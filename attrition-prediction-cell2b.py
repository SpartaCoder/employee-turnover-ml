# ================================================
# Cell 2b: Create a Balanced Dataset and Visualize Feature with NULL values
# Context: 
#   - Balance data by matching the number of "Attrition = Yes" and "Attrition = No" records.
#   - Include only features with meaningful correlation to Attrition (from cor_df).
#   - Visualize the completeness (non-null counts) of features by Attrition class.
# ================================================
# --- Step 0: Define which columns to keep based on prior correlation analysis ---
# cor_df is assumed to be available from the previous analysis (cell2a), with "To Remove" column.
cols_to_keep = cor_df[cor_df["To Remove"] == False].index.tolist()

# Always ensure 'Attrition' column is included for filtering and visualization
if 'Attrition' not in cols_to_keep:
    cols_to_keep.append('Attrition')

# --- Step 1: Select all records where Attrition == "Yes" (the minority class), keeping only relevant columns ---
yes_records = train.loc[train['Attrition'] == 'Yes', cols_to_keep].copy()

# --- Step 2: Randomly select an equal number of "No" records for a balanced dataset ---
num_yes = len(yes_records)
no_candidates = train.loc[train['Attrition'] == 'No', cols_to_keep]
no_records = no_candidates.sample(n=num_yes, random_state=42).copy()  # random_state ensures reproducibility

# --- Step 3: Concatenate "Yes" and "No" samples to create a balanced DataFrame ---
train_balanced = pd.concat([yes_records, no_records], axis=0).reset_index(drop=True)

# --- Step 4: Create an unbalanced dataset with the same selected columns for comparison ---
train_unbalanced = train[cols_to_keep].copy()

# --- Step 5: Calculate counts of non-null values for each feature, broken down by Attrition value ---
# This helps visualize the "missingness" or completeness of each feature across classes.
features = [col for col in cols_to_keep if col != 'Attrition']  # Exclude target column from feature list
counts_by_attrition = (
    train_balanced.groupby('Attrition')[features]
    .apply(lambda df: df.notnull().sum())
    .T  # Transpose so features are on the x-axis for plotting
)

# --- Step 6: Visualize feature missingness as a stacked bar chart ---
